Code implementing a simple blockchain, including transactions, mining, and rewards

This code was part of my Msc Data Science degree at University of London.

RUNNING:
Run main.py to start mining.

SCRIPTS:
- Main blockchain elements - transactions.py, blocks.py, chain.py 
- Two test codes - test_blocks, test_chain; that respectively test blocks.py and chain.py
- Connection code files - connections.py, mempool.py, miner.py, node.py, persistence.py 
- Miscellanous - blockchain_utils.py contains helper functions
